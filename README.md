Anomaly Detection
1. Overview
This repository provides tools and models for detecting anomalies in datasets across various domains. It leverages advanced algorithms like machine learning, deep learning, or statistical approaches to identify patterns and deviations from normal behavior.

2. Features
Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing data.
Multiple anomaly detection techniques: (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, etc.).
Visualization tools for analyzing detected anomalies.

3. Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the example script: python run_anomaly_detection.py
